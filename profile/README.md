<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Instrument Tuner is a tool that transforms an Android device into a portable chromatic tuner, enabling musicians to tune a wide variety of instruments directly using the device's microphone. The app aims to simplify and speed up the tuning process without additional hardware.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Wide detection range covering from A0 (27.50 Hz) up to C8 (4186.01 Hz) - suitable for many instruments.</li>
  <li>Chromatic tuner mode - automatically detects any pitch and displays the nearest note with tuning offset.</li>
  <li>Support for multiple instruments: guitar, bass, violin, viola, cello, ukulele, and more.</li>
  <li>Tone generator: the app can produce reference tones across full pitch range from A0 to C8 for manual tuning by ear.</li>
  <li>Special tuning modes including orchestral tuning (adjust concert-pitch reference) and optional temperaments/tempering systems for advanced tuning preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Selling Points</h2>
<p>Instrument Tuner combines portability, ease of use and professional-grade tuning accuracy (±1 cent) in a lightweight Android app. Its wide pitch detection range and flexible tuning modes make it suitable not only for standard string instruments but also for less common ones.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This app is ideal for guitarists, bassists, violinists, ukulele players - amateurs and professionals alike - as well as for musicians needing quick instrument tuning on the go. It's also suitable for teachers or students requiring a simple tuning tool without extra equipment.</p>
